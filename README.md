# ChatRoom
A Socket-io based community chat application
Helps people talk in real time over internet
To send private chat use @username in begining of message
(IMP: Persons with same username can exist, it was intentionally done,
      and yes private message will be recieved by both of them)
      
Feel free to contribute the UI and Security (Read my code security is seriously flawed here :p ).
